**Abstract:** The past few years have witnessed a surge in the number of advanced network adapters, known as "SmartNICs", that offer additional functionalities beyond standard packet processing capabilities. These devices often feature programmable lightweight processing cores, FPGAs, and even CPU- and GPU-based platforms capable of running separate operating systems. Though primarily aimed at data center operations, such as infrastructure management, packet filtering, and I/O acceleration, SmartNICs are increasingly being explored for high-performance computing (HPC) application acceleration.

This tutorial offers an in-depth exploration of the state-of-the-art for SmartNICs and the emerging software ecosystems supporting them. Attendees will engage in hands-on exercises to better understand how to use SmartNICs for HPC application acceleration, including MPI collective operation offloading, OpenMP offload, and algorithmic modifications to maximize on-board processing power. Participants will have the opportunity to execute these exercises using cutting-edge SmartNICs like NVIDIA's BlueField-3 Data Processing Unit (DPU). The tutorial presenters will discuss additional techniques for optimizing applications to harness SmartNICs as communication accelerators in HPC systems.

Please note that you must register for the SC23 tutorial track and attend this tutorial in person.
